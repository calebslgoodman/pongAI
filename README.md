A custom Pong game environment built with pygame and used to train a PyTorch-based AI agent.
This project demonstrates how reinforcement learning techniques can be applied to a classic arcade game, turning it into an interactive testbed for experimenting with state representations, reward functions, and autonomous decision-making.
Unfortunately, due to issues with git, I had to rewrite the master branch to be the main branch, and version history was partially lost.
